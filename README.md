# PV-Battery-Hybrid-Power-System
MATLAB/Simulink model of a PVâ€“Battery Hybrid Power System with simulation results, analysis, and documentation. Includes PV modeling, battery integration, and performance under varying load conditions.

ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**

This project simulates a **PVâ€“Battery hybrid system** using MATLAB/Simulink.  
The system integrates a photovoltaic (PV) array with a lithium-ion battery and is regulated using a **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm** and **PI controllers** to maintain stable DC bus voltage under varying solar irradiance and load conditions.  

âš¡ **Key Features**

- PV array model with configurable irradiance and temperature.  
- MPPT algorithm (Perturb & Observe) to extract maximum power from PV.  
- Lithium-ion battery model for charging/discharging with cutoff and full-charge limits.  
- PI controllers for **Vbus** and **Ibus** stability.  
- PWM switching at 5 kHz for efficient converter control.  
- Simulation validates reliable hybrid power delivery with stable voltage and current.  

ðŸ›  **Tools & Skills**

- MATLAB/Simulink  
- Power Electronics (DCâ€“DC Converters)  
- Control Systems (PI controllers, MPPT)  
- Renewable Energy Systems Integration
